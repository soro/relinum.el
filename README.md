Relinum
=======

As it says in the description, this mode is basically linum-mode by Markus Triska, modified to provide relative line numbers. I called it relinum so it can coexist with normal linum-mode.
I wasn't able to find a package that provided relative line numbers and since I like to use Viper and Vimpulse, I was sorely missing this feature.

Installation
------------

To install, either clone this repository or download relinum.el, put it somewhere on your load path and add <code>(require 'relinum)</code> to your emacs config.
